          The reader should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other
          persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or
          that are on the SDN list. As a project based primarily on open-source software, there is a risk that
          sanctioned persons may bypass prohibitions and access the code comprising the Spores blockchain protocol (or
          other project code or applications).
        </p>

        <p className="mt-5 mb-5 font-base">
          Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the Spores blockchain protocol may be
          sanctioned persons and that transactions with such individuals would violate U.S. export controls and
          sanctions law. This risk applies to individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that deploy,
          integrate, or use the Spores blockchain protocol code directly (e.g., as a node operator), as well as
          individuals that transact on the Spores blockchain through light clients, third-party interfaces, and/or
          wallet software.
